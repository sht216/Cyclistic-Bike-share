# Cyclistic-Bike-share

## The mission statement
The bike sharing company wants to analyze their user data to find the main differences in behaviour between their two types of users, the “casual” who pays for each ride and the annual member who pays a yearly subscription to the service.

## Objective of Analysis
### Identify the business task:
The company wants to improve their earnings reaching out to their “casual” riders, and for that they have to analyze in what aspects the “casual” and the annual customers differ, to be able to create a focused and successful marketing message to the “casual” customers that makes them change to the annual subscription.

### Key stakeholders:
The main stakeholders here are the director of marketing and my manager Lily Moreno, the rest of the marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team.

### The business task:
Given these facts, the business task is defined as searching for differences in the two identified kinds of users in order to make a focused marketing campaign to the “casual” users in order for them to change to the annual subscription, or resumed in a question:
What could motivate the “casual” users to change to an annual subscription based on their behavior?

### Credibility of the data:
The data is public data from a bike sharing company. It starts from the year 2013 until 2021 (three months), there isn't much of a naming convention as the files are sometimes organized by quarter, or month, or the whole year and their names vary a lot. The naming of the columns also changes and there are some columns added and deleted over the years. Nevertheless the data seems to be in good condition and its first hand data collected by the company itself with lots of entries and with lots of useful data.

* It seems that the casual users travel the same average distance than the member users, but they have much longer rides, that would indicate a more leisure oriented usage vs a more "public transport" or pragmatic use of the bikes by the annual members.
* This idea is reinforced by the fact that annual users have a very stable use of the service during the week, but the casual users are more of a weekend user.

* Here we can see that the annual members use both types of bikes for their rides, but the casual users show a clear preference for the electric bikes, which makes sense given the long duration of their rides.
* On a weekly basis we can see that for the annual members there is a small difference of usage between the start of the week, where they prefer the classic bike and the end of the week, where they use more electric bikes.
* For the casual users we see in general the same pattern of usage from the previous weekly charts, preferring the electric vs the classic bikes and having a weekend usage of the service.

* The coordinates data resulted to be very interesting, as we can clearly see the casual is usually located around the center of the town, with all their trips located around that area which makes sense given that they have a more relaxed leisure rides, on weekends probably also tourist or sightseeing related rides, that naturally focus more on the downtown area where most of the interest points are.
* This contrasts heavily with the longer range of the annual users that connect the downtown with the outskirts of the city, that would suggest they are mostly people that live outside the downtown and use the service to commute everyday to their works in the city.

## Conclusion
Taking in consideration both the business task: What could motivate the casual users to change to an annual subscription based on their behavior? and the insights we've learned from the available data we can make some conclusions.

1)The Casual users have leisure, and tourism rides mostly on weekends and using electric bikes.

2)The Annual users have commute or pragmatic rides, during all week using both electric & classic bikes
